# Customer-Retention-Report
This is an individual project using PowerBi where I have created an interactive dashboard to track and analyse the Customer Churn rate and Customer Risk Analysis.

In this project I have:
  - Used various parameters to drill down into the worksheet and customize it using filters and slicers.
  - Used different types of customized visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, maps and cards.
  - Performed calculations to manipulate data.
    
Using the aforementioned parameters I was able to analyse the following KPIs:
  - Customer Churn rate
  - Customer Demographics
  - Customer Account Information
  - Services customers signed up for
  - Net monthly and yearly charges

***Global Superstore.xlsx*** contains the dataset for this project. **Here is a screenshot of how the dataset looks like.**
